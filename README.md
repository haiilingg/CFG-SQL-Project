# Theme: Restaurant Ordering Database
This was the SQL Project I completed for Code First Girl's final presentation where I created 6 tables for a [restaurant ordering database](https://github.com/haiilingg/CFG-SQL-Project/blob/main/SQL%20Project-%20Restaurant%20Database%20(Hai%20Ling%20Tan).pdf)

# Project Overview
I've chosen the restaurant ordering system as my theme for this project as this is one of the areas I'm most interested in a sIreally enjoy eating good food at restaurants.

As the food delivery industry is growing especially after the pandemic, having a structured database to store necessary data is essential for restaurants when it comes to handling delivery orders.

This is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the order information for the delivery orders, as well to track the information of the payment and items in the menu.

Since the actual operations of a restaurant ordering system can be complicated, I've created a simplified database using the typical information that could be found in a restaurant's delivery database. The 6 tables created in this project covers the order, payment, customer, menu, user and chef detalls.

# Entity Relationship Diagram
The Restaurant Ordering Database is designed to stores details about the orders placed, customer information, payment information, chef, menus offered and user information of the employees that created the order. 

There are 6 tables in total, namely ORDERS, CUSTOMER, PAYMENT, USER, MENU and CHEF.
