# Theme: Restaurant Ordering Database
This was the SQL Project I completed for Code First Girl's final presentation where I created 6 tables for a restaurant ordering database.

# Project Overview
I've chosen the restaurant ordering system as my theme for this project as this is one of the areas I'm most interested in a sIreally enjoy eating good food at restaurants.

As the food delivery industry is growing especially after the pandemic, having a structured database to store necessary data is essential for restaurants when it comes to handling delivery orders.

This is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the order information for the delivery orders, as well to track the information of the payment and items in the menu.

Since the actual operations of a restaurant ordering system can be complicated, I've created a simplified database using the typical information that could be found in a restaurant's delivery database. The 6 tables created in this project covers the order, payment, customer, menu, user and chef detalls.

Please refer to the ER diagram showing the relationship between different tables within the database below and refer to [this document](https://github.com/haiilingg/CFG-SQL-Project/blob/main/SQL%20Project-%20Restaurant%20Database%20(Hai%20Ling%20Tan).pdf) for the different instructions used to create and run the queries within the database.

Despite facing some challenges while completing this project, I still enjoyed every bit of this project as it allows me to incorporate my creativity to come up with different ideas for creating logical queries.
